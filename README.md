**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of computers to understand and process human language. In other words, NLP seeks to teach computers to “talk” and “think” like humans when it comes to language.

NLP combines various statistical techniques, computational linguistics, and deep learning to understand language. Some basic techniques used include:

1. _Tokenization_: Dividing text into basic units such as words or sentences.
2. _Stemming and Lemmatization_: Reducing a word to its base form (e.g., “**ran**” becomes (“**ran**”).
3. _Tagging Parts of Speech_: Identifying the grammatical role of words in a sentence (e.g., **noun**, **verb**).
4. _Parser Builder_: Determines the grammatical structure of sentences.
5. _Word Representation_: Converts words into numeric vectors for easy processing by computers.
6. _Statistical Models and Deep Learning_: Using mathematical models and neural networks to analyze relationships between words and understand the meaning of text.

NLP is still developing and becoming more sophisticated. The ability of computers to understand and process human language is increasing, opening up opportunities for new applications and innovations in various fields.
